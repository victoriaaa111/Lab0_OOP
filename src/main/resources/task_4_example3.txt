The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a silent companion that has fascinated humans for centuries. Its surface, covered in craters, valleys, and ancient lava plains, tells the story of billions of years of cosmic history. The Moonâ€™s gravitational pull creates the tides on Earth, influencing the rise and fall of the oceans. During a full moon, the bright, reflective surface illuminates the night sky, casting a gentle glow on the landscape below. Scientists have studied the Moon's geology, searching for clues about the formation of our solar system. One of the most intriguing features is the concept of selenographical mapping, which involves detailed charting of the Moon's surface to understand its topography. The Moon continues to be a source of wonder and a symbol of exploration for humanity.
