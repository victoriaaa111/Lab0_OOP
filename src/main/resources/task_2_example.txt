The ocean is a vast and mysterious world, home to an incredible diversity of life. Deep beneath the waves, countless species of fish, mammals, and invertebrates thrive. Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," host a dazzling array of creatures, from the tiny shrimp to the colorful parrotfish. In the open ocean, massive schools of fish travel together, while majestic whales glide effortlessly through the water. One of the most remarkable inhabitants of the deep sea is the archaeoacoustically gifted dolphin, which uses echolocation to navigate and hunt. The sea is a delicate ecosystem, where each creature, from the smallest plankton to the largest predator, plays a vital role in maintaining balance.
