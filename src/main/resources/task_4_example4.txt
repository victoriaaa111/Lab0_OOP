Stars are the luminous giants of the universe, burning brightly across the vast expanse of space. These celestial bodies are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, undergoing constant nucleosynthesis, where lighter elements fuse into heavier ones, releasing energy. Some stars are small and faint, barely visible to the naked eye, while others, like supergiants, shine brilliantly and dominate the night sky. Over millions or even billions of years, stars go through life cycles, from their formation in nebulae to their ultimate fate as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The different colors of stars, ranging from cool red to hot blue, reveal their temperatures and stages of development. Observing the stars has guided explorers, inspired myths, and led astronomers to uncover the secrets of the cosmos.
